# CO2 Interactive Dashboard
## Project Background
Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate change. Itâ€™s widely recognised that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to urgently reduce emissions. But, how this responsibility is shared between regions, countries, and individuals has been an endless point of contention in international discussions.

## Task Summary
+ Conducted data preprocessing and visualization to evaluate CO2 emissions, GDP, and sources globally.
+ Developed an interactive dashboard by leveraging Python Panel library and UI widgets for user exploration of temporal CO2 emissions by continent and other pertinent factors.
